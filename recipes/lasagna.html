                <li>1 (28-ounces) can whole, peeled tomatoes </li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the sausage</li>
                <p> In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Either slice the sausage into rounds or remove the casing from the sausage by slicing lengthwise down the side and cook it like ground sausage.

                    When the oil shimmers, add the sausage to the pan, and cook for about 6 minutes or until browned. Use a cooking utensil to break the sausage up as you cook it. Transfer to a plate. </p>
                <li>Snip the tomatoes</li>
                <p>Open the can of tomatoes and use a large pair of scissors to snip and break them up in the can into chunky pieces. You will mash them a little more in the skillet. </p>
                <li>Make the sauce</li>
                <p>In the same skillet you used to brown the sausage, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and oregano. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the garlic sizzles. Add the tomatoes with their juices, salt, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the sauce is hot. </p>
                <p>Use a potato masher to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces (this is easiest to do when tomatoes soften in the heat). You are aiming for a chunky sauce. </p>
                <p>Add the sausage back to the pan and cook for 10 minutes. Taste, and add more salt and sugar, if you like. </p>
            </ol>
            
        </p>
